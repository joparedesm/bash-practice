# Bash Practice

This is a collection of bash scripts I wrote to practice various concepts and techniques in bash scripting. Each script is designed to perform a specific task or demonstrate a particular skill.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you'll need to have a working installation of bash on your system. You can check if you have bash installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash --version```

If you don't have bash installed, you can download it [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

## Running the Scripts

To run a script, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:

```bash script_name.sh```

or in a bash shell:

```./script_name.sh```

Replace script-name.sh with the name of the script you want to run.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request. I'm always open to suggestions for new scripts to add to this collection.
